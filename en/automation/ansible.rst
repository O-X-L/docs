Intro
#####

The tool (*or framework*) named `RedHat Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/how-ansible-works/>`_ can be used to automate a wide range of activities in IT.

It is Open-Source and **free to use**!

There is **support for managing**:

* Network devices
* Linux servers
* Windows servers
* Cloud platforms
* Virtualization platforms
* Services / APIs
* ...

See: `Ansible Collection Index <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index.html>`_

Ansible enables you to implement `Infrastructure-as-Code <https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac>`_ to manage your IT environment.

Using **IaC has some powerful advantages**:

* **Simplify complex setups** by leveraging abstraction
* **Empower non-technical staff** to perform complex IT tasks
* **Increase the efficiency** of your IT department
* **Reproducible installations**
* **Versioned configuration**
* **Implement changes quickly and safely**
* **Ability to roll back changes**
* **Introduce processes for approving changes**
* **Catch errors before implementation**

Note: IaC like this also requires some kind of `Version Control System (like Git) <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control>`_.

.. tip::

    We can `support you to implement Ansible and Infrastructure-as-Code <https://www.oxl.app/automation>`_!
